# Project "Flow Diary" Meeting Summary

---

## Project Overview
* [cite_start]**Project Name**: Flow Diary (formerly discussed as a visual/AI diary)[cite: 2].
* [cite_start]**Target Audience**: Non-verbal students who face challenges in recalling or sharing their daily activities due to poor working memory[cite: 28, 31].
* [cite_start]**Core Goal**: Develop an AI system that uses passively collected data (e.g., from smartwatches or phones) to build a visual diary for students to share with their family or support network[cite: 29].

## Allison’s Key Expectations & Requirements
* [cite_start]**From Tracking to Teaching**: The app should serve as a teaching tool to help students learn the words for where they were and express their life, rather than just being a tracking device for parents[cite: 142].
* **Visual-First Logic**:
    * [cite_start]Use chronological visual schedules (similar to the "Choice Works" app) to trigger memories and language[cite: 105, 130, 138].
    * [cite_start]Incorporate simple labels (e.g., "Pool") alongside pictures to support language acquisition [cite: 138-140].
* **Micro-Level Detail**:
    * [cite_start]Tracking should be granular enough to distinguish between specific rooms within a school (e.g., art room, gym, or pool) rather than just broad city-wide GPS locations [cite: 97-98, 103].
    * [cite_start]The system should ideally identify if a student deviates from their planned schedule [cite: 76-77].
* [cite_start]**Health & Emotional Support**: Use biometric data (e.g., heart rate from an Apple Watch) to detect stress or atypical responses during the school day [cite: 145-147, 174].

## Technical & Ethical Constraints
* **Strict Privacy Protocols**:
    * [cite_start]Storing actual photos of children on personal devices or databases is a major barrier due to legal, consent, and storage issues [cite: 52-53, 166-167].
    * [cite_start]**Alternative**: Use stock photos, pre-loaded images of specific school areas (e.g., a reading corner), or Google Street View imagery [cite: 68-69, 176, 178].
* **Hardware Strategy**:
    * [cite_start]Early elementary students (K–G4) cannot reliably carry phones as they may lose or break them [cite: 185-186].
    * [cite_start]Robust wearables like AirTag bracelets or trackers buckled to the child are preferred for younger demographics [cite: 188, 213-214].
* **Precision Localization**:
    * [cite_start]Exploration of Bluetooth Beacons or NFC tags to ensure room-level accuracy where GPS signals might drift [cite: 191, 195, 198-201].
* [cite_start]**Primary Platform**: Preference for iPad compatibility, as many non-verbal students already use iPads for assistive communication[cite: 220, 225].

## Logistics & Next Steps
* [cite_start]**Meeting Frequency**: The team will hold bi-weekly progress meetings[cite: 236, 241].
* [cite_start]**Allison's Availability**: Tuesday through Friday after 3:30 PM[cite: 238].
* [cite_start]**University Support**: Access to potential budget for specialized hardware (e.g., AirTags) and existing university software licenses[cite: 211, 230].
